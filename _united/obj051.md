description: Fierce Fronteriza seeks to inspire hope + consciousness + action to create
  a more just world by sharing the histories and stories of border people through
  essays, photographs, and interviews. Centering history from the periphery provides
  us different perspectives; invisible connections and alliances become visible. Trauma
  and perseverance live side by side. These histories reveal the past, illuminate
  the present, and provide us a vision for the future.
