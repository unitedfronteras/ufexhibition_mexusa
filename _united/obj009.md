  Border Perspective provides educational border trips and uses gallery-like exhibits, written stories, and artist talks to challenge beliefs and understanding about a complex and tumultuous region of our country.

  Border Perspective started as an exploration trip along the U.S./Mexico border, showcasing real stories of the people who live there. In early 2017, Yonathan and Jordan Moya took a 9-day photographic journey along the border, traversing almost 2,000 miles through the southern states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

  The Moya brothers have lived most of their adult lives in the Midwest, but they grew up on the border. Yet, despite their upbringing, they realized they didn't know everything about life on the border.
