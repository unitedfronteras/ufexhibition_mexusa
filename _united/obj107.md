description: The Robert Runyon Photograph Collection of the South Texas Border Area,
  a collection of 8,241 items, is a unique visual resource documenting the Lower Rio
  Grande Valley during the early 1900s. Donated by the Runyon family to the Briscoe
  Center for American History in 1986, it includes glass negatives, lantern slides,
  nitrate negatives, prints, and postcards, representing the life's work of commercial
  photographer Robert Runyon (1881-1968), a longtime resident of South Texas. His
  photographs document the history and development of South Texas and the border,
  including the Mexican Revolution, the U.S. military presence at Ft. Brown and along
  the border prior to and during World War I, and the growth and development of the
  Rio Grande Valley.
