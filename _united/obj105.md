description: "The LHP is a faculty-student research project that aims to enhance undergraduate
  education and provide resources on Latina/o and Chicana/o history in the Central
  Texas region. While the project began with the goal of digitizing the Rostros y
  Almas/Faces and Souls\x9D exhibit on local Tejanas, it has grown to encompass the
  broader mission of enhancing understandings of Latina/o and Chicana/o history. The
  LHP does so through the collection of oral histories from past and present members
  of Southwestern community as well as several activists, including key figures in
  the Chicana/o Movement in Texas."
