description: The Institute of Oral History was established in 1972 for the purpose
  of "preserving the history of the region adjacent to the Rio Grande both in the
  United States and in Mexico." Since that time, the Institute has built one of the
  largest border-related oral history collections in the United States. While an emphasis
  has been on the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez region, the collection also contains interviews
  dealing with the history of communities all along the U.S.-Mexico border. These
  materials cover a wide range of subjects, spanning social, economic, political,
  cultural and artistic concerns.
