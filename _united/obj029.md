description: Corridos is a interactive video game, done with open source tools including
  Blender, distributed freely in the internet as a downloadable application, running
  on all platforms. The game is an installation to make a statement about the US-Mexican
  border and drug trafficking. While the game experience still allows the player to
  be put into the Mexican drug trafficking culture, the way in which the game is operated
  can really change the experience. The computer game is centralized around the idea
  of driving drugs across the border while listening to Corridos music, which is really
  making a statement about the culture of drug trafficking between the US-Mexican
  border. The game takes players through secret tunnels where they can drive across
  (under) the border at fast speeds or sit for hours at border controls. However,
  the game is so much more than fast cars and cool music. It focuses on the illegal
  exchanges that take place across our borders and how that affects our society.
