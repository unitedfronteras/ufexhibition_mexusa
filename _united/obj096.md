description: Between 1910 and 1920 ethnic Mexicans living on the Texas-Mexico border
  were targets of state-sanctioned violence. Although historians estimate that several
  thousand Mexican nationals and American citizens were killed, this period of violence
  has received little public attention. Refusing to Forget, an educational non-profit,
  hopes that in bringing public awareness to this often forgotten period, we can also
  raise the profile of a struggle for justice and civil rights that continues to influence
  social relationships today.
