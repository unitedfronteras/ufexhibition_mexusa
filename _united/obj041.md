description: This project is intended to show and document the moments of Mexican
  history that are dedicated to Ciudad Juarez...of those who have lived in this border
  city, who from anywhere in Mexico camo to this site receiving the welcome, waiting
  for the opportunity to show the different events that occurred in each span of its
  extension that are still unknown. The project creates a photographic community archive
  to show the world how valuable Ciudad Juarez is. The site mentiones that as "Natives
  or not, we have a duty to make known the value of this land that daily stives to
  show its Heroism that gives it the strength of being the Refuge of Freedom, Custody
  of the Republic..."
