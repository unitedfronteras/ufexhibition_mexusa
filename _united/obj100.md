description: It used to be similar to Juaritos Literario serving as research and citizen
  intervention project that had as a priority the identification and digitization
  of literary works (almost a thousand); publication of reviews-blog posts and the
  experience of touring them; and, most importantly, the design of literary routes
  and the implementation of urban walks around the heritage that written discourse
  has established from the state of Nuevo Leon.
