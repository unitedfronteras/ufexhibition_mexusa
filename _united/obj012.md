description: Border Tuner is a large-scale participatory art installation. It is designed
  to interconnect El Paso and Ciudad Juarez and to highlight the complex and long-term
  collaboration that exists between the two cities and the two countries, providing
  a powerful and positive counter-narrative to the current rhetoric over the border.
  The piece was installed between Mexico and the United States, where powerful robotic
  reflectors create bridges of light that open live sound channels for communication
  across the border. The piece creates a fluid canopy of visible light for up to 10
  miles. Visitors can move the lights in six interactive stations, three located in
  Chamizal de Juarez Park and three at Bowie High School in El Paso. Each of the interactive
  stations features a custom-made music stand with a microphone, a speaker and a large
  knob or dial. When a participant turns the dial; Three nearby reflectors create
  an arm of light that follows the movement of the dial, automatically scanning the
  horizon. When two of those arms of light meet in the sky and intersect, a sound
  channel opens between people in the two remote stations. While they talk and listen,
  the brightness of the light bridge is modulated in synchronization, a flash like
  a twinkle of the Morse code. Each interactive station can tune in to any other station,
  so, for example, a participant in Mexico can connect to the three US-based stations.
  UU. or the other two in Mexico, as desired.
