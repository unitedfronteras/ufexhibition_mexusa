description: This project maps sites of conflict between Native Americans and Euro-Americans
  in Texas from the creation of the First Mexican Republic to the outbreak of the
  U.S.-Mexico War (1821-1846). Its data is particularly valuable in allowing researchers
  to learn more about the mobility patterns of the nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes
  of Texas, and how these patterns changed over time. It will also give us a more
  complete picture of the wide-ranging nature of inter-ethnic conflict in Texas.
