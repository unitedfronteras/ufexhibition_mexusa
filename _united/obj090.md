description: 'In light of border wall building for the past 10+ years in the Rio Grande
  Valley of Tejas with the federal government''s plans for more, and in light of additional
  policies that negatively affect us, our families, and our communities, Resistencia:
  Poets Against Walls Collective aims to tell, document, and share communal stories
  from individual perspectives--through poetry, testimonio, and the spoken word--about
  life here en la frontera, stories and/or points of view the media often misses.
  We seek to do and create "work that matters" as per the late Valley writer and visionary
  Gloria E. Anzaldua, and through our resistencia, help cultivate social change.'
