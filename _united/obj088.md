description: This project combines written oral stories, based on the tradition of
  oral stories, with maps to create a modern version of Pee Posh's migration. Pee
  Posh, is a group of indigenous peoples from southern Parker, Arizona and north of
  Blythe, California, on the Colorado River. The Pee Posh were originally part of
  a larger society of tribal affiliations labeled as Patans, these tribal nations
  spoke the original language of Yuman and had lands from Baja California that extended
  north of Parker, west to the coast of southern California and east on the Gila River
  near the Mohawk Mountains.
