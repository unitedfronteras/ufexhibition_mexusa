description: The project is composed of a map that shows the geographical location
  where some of the girls and women victims of feminicide in Ciudad Juarez from 1993
  to date were killed, abandoned and / or found. This monitoring and mapping of femicides
  is made up of two parts. The first part includes from 1993 to 2014. To register
  the femicides committed in these years, the official information of government agencies
  as well as from non-governmental organizations, civil associations, newspapers,
  and information collected before from activists, writers, women and feminists was
  used. The second part includes from 2015 to date. At this time, the same creator
  has been monitoring and recording daily the femicides committed in the city through
  the digital and written press, as well as in social networks.
