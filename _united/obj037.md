description: The objective of the Dona Ana Sphere Project is to contribute towards
  a fuller understanding of both crisis and dispute resolution during natural disaster,
  war and military occupation. From 1828 to the 1850s, a series of floods devastated
  the mostly indigenous and mestizo communities of Paso Del Norte. This project will
  examine the strategies of the villagers of Dona Ana during the occupation of their
  village by the U.S. military. It will also examine the local Juez de Paz (Justice
  of the Peace) process in resolving the intra-village conflict precipitated by the
  flooding and inter-community migration. One of the key aims of this study is to
  understand, through diligent archival research, how the families of the Dona Ana
  Sphere negotiated and adapted to the political, economic and social realities of
  their time. Such a study may also reveal their tactics for the construction of a
  complicated peace.
