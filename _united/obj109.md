description: Under The Borderlands Project, Schlyer has focused a decade of work on
  documenting the US-Mexico borderlands and the impact U.S. border and immigration
  policy are having on the wildlife, people and ecosystems of the region. This endeavor
  has included collaborative projects with the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife,
  the National University of Mexico City, the International League of Conservation
  Photographers, and many other organizations and individuals. Photography and video
  in Embattled Borderlands was donated by many talented individuals, including the
  team of photographers that participated in the iLCP Borderlands Expedition in 2009.
