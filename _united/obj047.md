description: VR is hailed for its ability to transport. The Family Reunions Project
  (FRP) is using this power to create immersive virtual reunions between undocumented
  immigrants and their families abroad. The FRP consists of two components. 1) Virtual
  Reunions via VR Postcards. VR Postcards consist of 360-degree video experiences
  that are pre-recorded and screened privately for families that have been separated
  due to immigration status. As VR technology advances, so too does our ability to
  connect people across distances. Our most recent "VR Postcards" have included room-scale
  3D recreations of homes via photogrammetry. 2) Storytelling. The FRP culminated
  with "Home with America," a VR documentary around one of the families that participated
  in the FRP. In this award-winning documentary, Gladys, an undocumented immigrant,
  cannot visit her dying mother, America. Defying this separation, Gladys finds a
  way, however ephemeral, to reunite with her mother.
