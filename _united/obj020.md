description: The Borderlands expedition has helped document the wildlife, landscapes,
  and human communities of the borderlands, and the impact the border wall is having
  on them. This expedition is now taking their own story to the public and policy
  makers, and are using the images to enhance the reach to a coalition of groups and
  people working on this issue. The photographers in this project have been featured
  in videos, exhibits, and documentaries that have been shown to various governmental
  offices in an attempt to impact the decisions made in terms of border security.
