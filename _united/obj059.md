description: This project visibilizes a range of humanitarian problems that have been
  generated by the massive displacement of humans as a consequence of mismanagment
  on both sides of the US-Mexico border. It employs digital narrative, digital genre
  that puts the content and production control in the hands of community narrators
  (deported and others affected by deportation and deportability),  to produce a public
  archive that gives the deportation crisis a human face.
