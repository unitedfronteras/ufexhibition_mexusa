description: "A mobilized humanities project that emerges from the immigration crisis
  that started at the United States-Mexico border. Creating visualizations, Volume
  1 aggregates and cross-references publicly available data to visualize the geography
  of zero tolerance\x9D immigration policy in 2018 and immigration incarceration in
  the USA in general. This initial volume highlights the landscapes, families, and
  communities affected by the massive web of immigrant detention in the United States.
  Volume 2 explores the financial landscape of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (ICE) and the impact of its increased investment in detention, enforcement, and
  deportation of immigrant families."
