description: The exhibit focuses on three distinct moments when maps played an integral
  role in the transformation of Mexico and its political geography. In the sixteenth
  century, early colonial pictographic maps drawn by indigenous artists reflect the
  growth of Spanish colonial administration. These maps show how indigenous elites
  adapted pre-Hispanic visual traditions to Europeanized forms of documentation to
  record their histories and defend claims to land and power. In the eighteenth century,
  new maps of Mexicos principal cities serve as both representations and instruments
  of the viceregal governments efforts to re-order and regulate Mexican social life
  and public spaces. In the nineteenth century, maps are central to the military struggle
  for independence and the defense of contested national borders.
