description: Delimitations is the first attempt to draw the border between Mexico
  and the United States from 1821 to 1847. It is a collective and nomadic artistic-community
  work carried out by Marco Ramirez, Erre, Richard Taylor, and Jose Inerzia. Although
  the blog that initially introduced the process is temporarily disabled, the coordinates
  in GPS can be viewed through a KMZ file (Google Earth).
