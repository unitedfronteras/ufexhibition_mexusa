description: Researchers, new media artists, and co-founders of the Electronic Disturbance
  Theater/b.a.n.g. lab, Ricardo Dominguez and Brett Stalbaum, together with a wider
  team of poets and professors, devised the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT) to improve
  the odds of a safe crossing of the Mexico U.S. border. Thousands of people have
  died in their journey, mostly due to its vertiginous and deserted geography. The
  TBT consists of a GPS system (in this case, standing for Geo Poetic System) with
  24 hours of experimental poetry aimed at providing not only inspiration for survival,
  but also information on food/water caches, security activities, and directions to
  potentially safer routes. Its simple, user-friendly interface is designed as an
  easy hack to low-cost cell phones.
creators: Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) 2.0/B.A.N.G. Lab, University of California,
  San Diego (UCSD), Ricardo Dominguez, Brett Stalbaum, Micha Cardenas, Amy Sara Carroll,
  and Elle Mehrmand (the artists)
