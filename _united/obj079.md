description: The project presentes the work of Monroe Nathan Work, who lived from
  1866 1945. This website is a rebirth of one piece of his work. In his career, he
  felt compelled to document every known lynching that was happening in the United
  States. The project is an update of Monroe Works legacy using digital tools to list
  again every known lynching, including what has been clarified or newly uncovered
  in contemporary research. Each record here has a footnote inviting you to investigate
  for yourself.
