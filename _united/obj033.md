description: Dentimundo.com is a multimedia documentary of this micro-economy between
  the U.S. and Mexico that investigates border dentistry while also presenting users
  with a directory of dentist clinics along the border. Dentimundo is a new online
  directory of Mexican dentists on the border with the United States.El Progresso,
  Ojinaga, Juarez, Nogales, Mexicali, Tijuana, are all Mexican towns or cities that
  sit on the edge of the United States. These are border sites that have established
  a direct simbiotic relationship with the U.S. economy by providing a variety of
  services to U.S. citizenry and attracting U.S. dollars. Dentist clinics are as prominent
  as three for a dollar tacos, margarita specials and Mexican panchos. What deficits
  in the U.S. health system is causing this outflow to Mexico? How do the dentists
  on each side of the border view one another? Where do U.S. citizens prefer to have
  their teeth cleaned and why? These are just a few of the questions that come to
  mind when considering the immense quantity of Mexican dentists along the Mexico/United
  States border.
