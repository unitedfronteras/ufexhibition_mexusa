description: This political advocacy project is dedicated to elaborate a bilingual
  digital archive on Childhood Arrivals, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
  beneficiaries and their immediate family and friends through Digital Storytelling.
  By implementing the methodology, the archive hosts videos of two to five minutes
  in length narrated in the first person and elaborated by participants. The intention
  is to give agency to the participants and to allow them to construct an image of
  this specific group. Equally important, the archive aims to contribute qualitative
  information and enhance public debate and policy through the testimonies centered
  on the experiences of DACA recipients.
