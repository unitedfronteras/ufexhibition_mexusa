  The Puente Human Rights Movement is a grassroots migrant justice organization based in Phoenix, Arizona. We develop, educate, and empower migrant communities to protect and defend our families and ourselves.  We organize to build our communitys power with a Closed Fist, Open Hand Strategy.
  With a closed fist, we fight enforcement that criminalizes our people through racial profiling, police-ICE collaboration, and the detention and deportation system.With an open hand, we combat attrition policies that try to make our lives unliveable, by building an inclusive community.
