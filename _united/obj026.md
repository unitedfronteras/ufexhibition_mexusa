description: Chronicling America is a Website providing access to information about
  historic newspapers and select digitized newspaper pages, and is produced by the
  National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP). NDNP, a partnership between the National
  Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC), is a long-term
  effort to develop an Internet-based, searchable database of U.S. newspapers with
  descriptive information and select digitization of historic pages. Supported by
  NEH, this rich digital resource will be developed and permanently maintained at
  the Library of Congress. An NEH award program will fund the contribution of content
  from, eventually, all U.S. states and territories.
