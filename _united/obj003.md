description: 'AMBOS Project started as a month long activation at the San Ysidro border
  crossing in Tijuana, but has evolved its focus to record and paint a picture of
  what life looks like along the length of the US/Mexico border for those who are
  unfamiliar with the realities that take place there. Through the different phases
  of the project, AMBOS has fostered a greater sense of interconnectedness in the
  border regions it has visited. AMBOS as a project has become multi-faceted. It is
  part documentation of the border, part collaboration with artists, part community
  activism, part exploration of identities influenced by the liminal zone of the borderlands.
  By connecting with local artists, activists, and makers in the border region, AMBOS
  is working to capture an accurate representation of the sister cities and communities
  on both sides. In making community-based art, AMBOS also functions as an emotional
  thermometer to gauge the health of policy and transnational relationships in each
  community. AMBOS seeks to generate healthier cross-border relationships between
  communities and governmental bodies by raising awareness of issues and opinion in
  the border region and amplifying them to an international audience. Through these
  efforts, AMBOS recontextualizes and calls attention to the importance and lack of
  accessibility at US borders. Using craft and art as a vehicle for community self-care,
  this project is aimed at humanizing the act of border crossing. '
