description: This map is in honor of all the Indigenous Nations [of colonial states].
  It seeks to highlight that all land has a creation story and we must remember to
  support and stand by the original people of the lands we call home. The hope is
  that it instills pride in the descendants of these People, brings an awareness of
  Indigenous history, the long lasting effects of colonialism and uplifts the Nations
  that have never stopped fight to protect the Earth for us all
