description: Steve Inskeep and a team of NPR journalists traveled the 1,900-mile length
  of the U.S.-Mexico border to report on the people, goods and culture that cross
  the heavily-fortified boundary. NPR News presents the dispatches and related coverage
  as the multipart series Borderland, exploring major issues such as immigration,
  the drug trade, business and cultural change through the personal stories of people
  who live where the countries meet.
