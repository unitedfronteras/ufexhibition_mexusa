description: 'A repository for bits and pieces of Texas culture. Collection with items
  Hernan Contreras''  family. The initial material is from south Texas, of particular
  interest are letters, photos, court documents, journals, certificates, wills, the
  stuff of ordinary people going about the business of wresting a living in the frontier.
  No myths; no legends just ordinary folks, for in the final analysis, it is the ordinary
  settler doing ordinary things under extraordinary circumstances that permanently
  forged the frontier. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a window through
  which we can see what it was like to be a Texan in the different eras. '
