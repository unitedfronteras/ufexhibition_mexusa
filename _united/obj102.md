description: The Texas Slavery Project examines the spread of American slavery into
  the borderlands between the United States and Mexico in the decades between 1820
  and 1850. American slaveholders began migrating to the Mexican province of Texas
  in the 1820s, where they established a society like those developing at the same
  time in Mississippi and Alabama. Tensions quickly rose between these Anglo settlers
  and the government of Mexico, which repeatedly attempted to outlaw slavery in Texas.
  Settlers in the region eventually rebelled from Mexico in 1836 and established the
  Republic of Texas. From 1836 to 1845, slaveholders from the American South poured
  into this new nation between the borders of the United States and Mexico. Centered
  on a database of slave and slaveholder populations in Texas during the Republic
  era (1837-45), the Texas Slavery Project offers a window into the role slavery played
  in the development of Texas in the years before the region became part of the United
  States. Dynamic interactive maps show the changing flows of enslaved and slaveholder
  populations in Texas over time. The population database search engine allows users
  to discover the growth of slave and slaveholder populations in the region. Digitized
  original documents from the era provide an opportunity to hear the voices of those
  who lived with slavery in early Texas
