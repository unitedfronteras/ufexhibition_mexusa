description: A goal of the Mapping History Project is to activate history through
  dynamic and viable interactive demonstrations of unknown stories. Another objective
  is to promote tolerance through understanding of diversity, which can be historically
  traced in an expanded history that reflects all communities that make up a place.
  Narratives interwoven upon historic maps from the Simon Burrow Map Collection at
  the School of Transborder Studies at ASU visualize histories and lived experiences
  of transborder populations along the United States and Mexico borderlands. Here
  stories of ancient peoples who have populated the regions since before Europeans
  discovered the Americas is paralleled with contemporary mainstream history of the
  Southwest.
