description: DIGIE is a vast collection of images and videos exploring El Pasos past
  and present. It examines its people and its many cultures on giant 3-D touch-sensitive
  TV screens at the Museum of History and on a mobile Mini-Digie as well. Our Mini-Digie
  will be transported to classrooms, malls, community centers and other locations
  where citizens gather so everyone has the opportunity to experience and be included
  in El Pasos digital history.
