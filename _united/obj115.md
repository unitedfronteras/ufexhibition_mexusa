description: Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) to bring to life Hostile Terrain
  94 (HT94) Augmented Reality (AR). This interactive experience opens a window into
  the odyssey that is clandestine migration across the US-Mexico border. Utilizing
  open-source data from government agencies, the installation maps more than 3,200
  toe tags with case file information from migrants whose bodies have been recovered
  on U.S. soil since the mid-1990s. Upon visiting the exhibition, you can point your
  phone at the toe tag wall and enter AR portals that give a glimpse into the stories
  of those that have crossed the Sonoran Desert via interviews, the unforgiving environment
  via 360-degree photos, and the cost of the journey via shrines and memorials for
  the fallen. The installation will travel to over 150 locations over the course of
  2020. They are also expanding the audience of the exhibitions by including an option
  in our app for users to access the content from anywhere in the world.
