description: The project designed and produced a bilingual virtual board game about
  daily life bicultural negotiation in San Diego/Tijuana for InSite 05. This game
  was designed using basic HTML, and thus is simple to use, so that populations unaccustomed
  to gaming will not be deterred by lengthy instructions or complicated maneuvers.
  The game looks like a board game, such as Monopoly or the Mexican version Turismo,
  and the movements around the board are simulated through "point and click" interaction
  with the screen. It ia a game to be played individually, like solitaire, in order
  to allow people who are not gaming devotees to partake of the game with ease. Players
  have the option to enter the game in English or Spanish and choose from among four
  player personae. The language and personae chosen determine the particular perspective
  on life experiences in the border region that each player have so that the more
  conversant one is in various idioms of the border, the more one can know about all
  the angles of the game and the more one has access to "insider" information on both
  sides of the border. The paths of each player allude to actual experiences that
  are typical of real life regular border crossers, from elderly Americans who go
  to Tijuana to buy cheaper prescription drugs medicine, to Mexican day laborers who
  make their way on foot along Route 5 each day and peddle their skills and trades
  in San Diego's suburbs. The game represents the US-Mexico border as material locality,
  and as representative of particular (corporate) practices. It focuses on the maquiladora
  or assembly plant, arguing that it is central to the work, and stands for post-Fordist
  late capitalism. Similar, it shows at how socio-economic inequalities of the border
  are encoded, and critiques the structural inequities of the border economy. In creating
  a virtual board game that acts as a refracted mirror of the sociocultural space
  of the US-Mexico border, we retrace the steps of the Surrealists and the Situationists
