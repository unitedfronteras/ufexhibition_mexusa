description: Students in the Fall 2015 junior seminar Race and Remembering compiled
  this digital exhibit, to illuminate historical and ongoing anti-immigrant and anti-Latinx
  violences through a focus on the U.S.-Mexico border. It exposes processes of colonization,
  racialization of Latinx populations, and policing that are fundamental to its history
  and legacy.
