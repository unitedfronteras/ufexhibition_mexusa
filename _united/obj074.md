description: 'A multifaceted project that includes compiling a digital archive of
  histories of racial violence, researching documented cases, curating content (including
  digital tours and historical essays), and an interactive map. The digital archive
  is the first to include multiple forms of violence (at the hands of law enforcement,
  US soldiers, and vigilantes) that targeted multiple racial and ethnic groups (African
  Americans, Mexican Americans, Mexican nationals, Asian Americans, Native Americans
  and European immigrants). Mapping Violence will be useful for a range of groups.
  Visitors will be able to learn from historical essays, a timeline, digital tours,
  and the descriptions of each event. The content developed for this project will
  help public users gain an understanding of the complexities of the history of racially-motivated
  violence. '
