description: Over the last ten years I have traveled to most major and some smaller
  cities on both sides of the 2000 miles long U.S.-Mexico border and photographed
  about 200 painters, photographers, musicians, writers, dancers, architects and art
  promoters in order to shine a spotlight on the vibrant cultural activities and cross-border
  opportunities that exist despite the tremendous challenges in this bi-national region.
