description: 'Tijuana Calling is an online curatorial project featuring five commissioned
  online art projects that address issues specific to the borderlands of Tijuana/San
  Diego, including migration and exchange, flows of capital and labor, surveillance
  and privacy, translation and cultural hybridity. These art projects will take the
  form of actions, events, performances and tactical interventions in public online
  spaces. As an extension of the inSite_05 web site, Tijuana Calling will document
  and link to these projects, but the projects themselves will happen elsewhere: in
  multiplayer online games, commerce sites, social network sites, wireless networks,
  and other online locations that form the virtual public domain of Tijuana/San Diego.'
