description: BORDERCLICK is a digital living archive exploring the complexities of
  the transfronterizo experience. Borderclick's mission aims to give lyrical visual
  representation to transfronterizx life through photography,360 video, and social
  media. By capturing the feelings, memories and experiences living between two cultures
  and nations, Mexico and the United States, they bring an authentic and honest challenge
  to the common stereotypes of border-crossers. Throughout this process of self-exploration,
  they have discovered that despite the intentionally isolating effects of the physical
  border wall, the challenge of crossing it on a daily basis, and its extensive violence
  upon their minds and bodies, they have managed to find and connect with one another
  and help visualize an otherwise invisible community. They have learned how to collaborate,
  engage others in dialogue around border issues, and pledge to continue to support
  each other and advocate for their communities in our pursuit of self-improvement,
  social justice, and civic engagement.
