description: The Arhoolie Foundation's Strachwitz Frontera Collection of Mexican and
  Mexican American Recordings is the largest repository of these commercially produced
  vernacular recordings in existence. The nearly 160,000 recordings in the collection
  were made primarily in the United States and Mexico and were issued on 78 rpm, 45
  rpm, and 33rpm (long-playing, or LP) phonograph records and cassette and reel-to-reel
  tapes. The earliest recording was made in 1908, and the latest recordings were released
  in the 1990s. These performances are divided into three sections, roughly by era.
  Because of the depth and breadth of each section, and because many of the recordings
  are irreplaceable, the Strachwitz Frontera Collection is unique.
