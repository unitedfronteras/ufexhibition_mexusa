description: Since 2010, Cognate Collective has developed research projects, public
  interventions, and experimental pedagogical programs in collaboration with communities
  across the US/Mexico border region. Their inter-disciplinary projects address issues
  of citizenship, migration, informal economies, and popular cultural, while arguing
  for understanding the border not as a bifurcating line, but as a region that expands
  and contracts with the movement of people and objects. They currently work between
  Tijuana, MX, San Diego, CA, Santa Ana, CA and Los Angeles, CA.
