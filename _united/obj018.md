description: 'Over the past eight years, Schlyeras work has focused heavily on documenting
  the US-Mexico borderlands and the changes brought about by US border and immigration
  policy. This project has included leading a 17-member expedition along the entire
  2,000-mile border with fellow photographers in the International League of Conservation
  Photographers. Schlyer curated a traveling exhibit from that expedition that has
  shown throughout the United States, including shows in the US House and Senate.
  This project included a book about the borderlands titled Continental Divide: Wildlife,
  People and the Border Wall, which has received national recognition, including the
  National Outdoor Book Award for 2013 and the Best of the Best of university presses
  honor from the American Library Association.'
