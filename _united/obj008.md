description: A robot, designed, of course, to cross borders specifically the border
  between Mexico and the United States. With the rise and reign of a president who
  won the support of xenophobes by promising a massive wall between the US and Mexico,
  this creation serves a poetic and political function. The project comprise a series
  of lightweight robotic sculptures that poetically explore the notion of borders
  and boundary conditions. The inflatable sculptures rise up to several stories high
  and extend across a given threshold. Their choreographed performance, originating
  on both sides of the border, would stage a symbolic connection. The project treats
  the border as a physical condition that can be temporarily transcended by technological
  proxies. It offers a critique of militarized geopolitical borders, and a metaphorical
  suspension of those borders in the form of temporary arches.
