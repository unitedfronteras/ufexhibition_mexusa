description: 'History Colorado shares the stories of Colorado''s past. The exhibition
  "The borderlands of southern Colorado" marks the site of the original El Pueblo,
  which was established in 1842 along the border and is well placed to tell the various
  stories. The river and the landscape of this place cover important history: from
  a meeting point between indigenous tribes to a physical border between nations,
  from a border between mountains and plains to a place of daily convergence between
  cultural and ethnic borders. This exhibition illuminates the geopolitical border
  history specific to this place, as well as the continuous regional borders of cultures,
  ethnic groups, landscapes, industries, religions and identities. Through an interactive
  map it shows the changing control zones over time to other videos, artifacts, and
  exhibits.'
