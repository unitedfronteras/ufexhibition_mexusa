description: The proyect is dedicated to locate, map, and facilitate the access of
  borderland periodicals. The objective of BAC is to create a transborder archive
  to visualize the newspaper production from 1808 to 1930 of both sides of the border
  in order to understand the region and its communities before and after it became
  a division line. This project uses postcolonial digital humanities practices to
  expand the notion of borders and facilitate the access to the material in order
  to promote diverse forms of research and communities involvement.
