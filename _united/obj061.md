description: The research and this citizen intervention project has as a priority
  the identification and digitization of literary works (almost a thousand); publication
  of reviews-blog posts (205) dealing with both fictional spaces and the experience
  of touring them; and, most importantly, the design of literary routes and the implementation
  of urban walks (8 in total) around the heritage that written discourse has established
  and from now on is tangible, patent and passable on this, our border.
