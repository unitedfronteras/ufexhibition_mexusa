description: The main goal of the project is to bring new public art of high artistic
  quality and enduring value to the world's largest land border entry and one of the
  busiest land border crossings in the world. At the same time, it intends to transform
  the public perception of deportability through institutional and societal engagement
  with the seven portraits and the 96 Quick Response (QR) codes plastered on the fence.
  The project incorporated Quick Response (QR) codes into a border wall to also provide
  the opportunity for people who cant go to Tijuana themselves to interact with the
  mural. As an additional resource to make the mural accessible to the public and
  educators, it has created a digital mural free to use and download.  The inclusion
  of QR codes has allowed audiences the opportunity to not only listen and watch the
  narratives but to also take agency in sharing the stories, facilitating their participation
  in creating consciousness of immigrant life in the U.S. and life after deportation.
  The project's approach to incorporate technology as a vehicle to connect the public
  to the art piece and the stories have been fruitful.
