description: The Linealist explores the history of New Mexican families, culture and
  ancestry. The project curates archival documents in the Digitized Records page,
  and offers research links in the Archive Portal. To illustrate the connections between
  and amongst New Mexican and Nueva Viscayan families, the Matrilineal and Patrilineal
  pages address the ancestral lines of the children of Elijio Chavez and Carmen Fierro.
