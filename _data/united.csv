Through the different phases of the project, AMBOS has fostered a greater sense of interconnectedness in the border regions it has visited. AMBOS as a project has become multi-faceted. It is part documentation of the border, part collaboration with artists, part community activism, part exploration of identities influenced by the liminal zone of the borderlands. By connecting with local artists, activists, and makers in the border region, AMBOS is working to capture an accurate representation of the sister cities and communities on both sides. In making community-based art, AMBOS also functions as an emotional thermometer to gauge the health of policy and transnational relationships in each community. AMBOS seeks to generate healthier cross-border relationships between communities and governmental bodies by raising awareness of issues and opinion in the border region and amplifying them to an international audience. Through these efforts, AMBOS recontextualizes and calls attention to the importance and lack of accessibility at US borders. Using craft and art as a vehicle for community self-care, this project is aimed at humanizing the act of border crossing.

The Family Reunions Project (FRP) is using this power to create immersive virtual reunions between undocumented immigrants and their families abroad. The FRP consists of two components. 1) Virtual Reunions via VR Postcards. VR Postcards consist of 360-degree video experiences that are pre-recorded and screened privately for families that have been separated due to immigration status. As VR technology advances, so too does our ability to connect people across distances. Our most recent ""VR Postcards"" have included room-scale 3D recreations of homes via photogrammetry. 2) Storytelling. The FRP culminated with ""Home with America,"" a VR documentary around one of the families that participated in the FRP. In this award-winning documentary, Gladys, an undocumented immigrant, cannot visit her dying mother, America. Defying this separation, Gladys finds a way, however ephemeral, to reunite with her mother.","Sumak Productions, Alvaro Morales, Frisly Soberanis, Cami Dominguez ",info@familyreunionsproject.com,https://www.facebook.com/FamilyReunionsProject,,,in progress
obj48,Feminist Border Arts Film Festival,https://wordpress.nmsu.edu/mjonet/,,"Held annually in April, the Feminist Border Arts Film Festival celebrates the power of cinema as a creative platform for filmmakers and viewers to confront urgent social issues. The festival emphasizes artistic vision in telling stories in short film (under 15 min.), including live-action narrative, documentary, and animation. It showcases student and professional filmmakers, domestic and international who create thought-provoking depictions of identity and difference that explore gender and identity, race, sexuality, class, transnationality, migration, refugees and displaced persons, dis/ability, the environment, as well as other important categories.

Located less than 50 miles from the U.S./Mexico border at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico, the Feminist Border Arts Film Festival is committed to thinking about margins. The festival defines feminist border arts as a practice that constantly reconfigures boundaries and challenges the limits of conventional representation. Borders are intersections. Intersectionality, the concept that social identities are multiple and overlapping, is the vision of the festival. Featured films are perspectives from the edge;  visions from the margins that create new ways of seeing. They revive the promise of cinema, the possibility of film.","Dr. M Catherine Jonet, New Mexico State University, Gender & Sexuality Studies/Interdisciplinary Studies Department",mjonet@nmsu.edu,,https://twitter.com/gensXprof,https://www.instagram.com/genxprof/,active

obj102,Texas Slavery Project,http://www.texasslaveryproject.org/,,"The Texas Slavery Project examines the spread of American slavery into the borderlands between the United States and Mexico in the decades between 1820 and 1850. American slaveholders began migrating to the Mexican province of Texas in the 1820s, where they established a society like those developing at the same time in Mississippi and Alabama. Tensions quickly rose between these Anglo settlers and the government of Mexico, which repeatedly attempted to outlaw slavery in Texas. Settlers in the region eventually rebelled from Mexico in 1836 and established the Republic of Texas. From 1836 to 1845, slaveholders from the American South poured into this new nation between the borders of the United States and Mexico. Centered on a database of slave and slaveholder populations in Texas during the Republic era (1837-45), the Texas Slavery Project offers a window into the role slavery played in the development of Texas in the years before the region became part of the United States. Dynamic interactive maps show the changing flows of enslaved and slaveholder populations in Texas over time. The population database search engine allows users to discover the growth of slave and slaveholder populations in the region. Digitized original documents from the era provide an opportunity to hear the voices of those who lived with slavery in early Texas","University of Virginia, The Summerlee Foundation of Dallas, and The Virginia Center for Digital History, Andrew J.

obj113,Turista Fronterizo,http://www.turistafronterizo.net/,,"The project designed and produced a bilingual virtual board game about daily life bicultural negotiation in San Diego/Tijuana for InSite 05. This game was designed using basic HTML, and thus is simple to use, so that populations unaccustomed to gaming will not be deterred by lengthy instructions or complicated maneuvers. The game looks like a board game, such as Monopoly or the Mexican version Turismo, and the movements around the board are simulated through ""point and click"" interaction with the screen. It ia a game to be played individually, like solitaire, in order to allow people who are not gaming devotees to partake of the game with ease. Players have the option to enter the game in English or Spanish and choose from among four player personae. The language and personae chosen determine the particular perspective on life experiences in the border region that each player have so that the more conversant one is in various idioms of the border, the more one can know about all the angles of the game and the more one has access to ""insider"" information on both sides of the border. The paths of each player allude to actual experiences that are typical of real life regular border crossers, from elderly Americans who go to Tijuana to buy cheaper prescription drugs medicine, to Mexican day laborers who make their way on foot along Route 5 each day and peddle their skills and trades in San Diego's suburbs. The game represents the US-Mexico border as material locality, and as representative of particular (corporate) practices. It focuses on the maquiladora or assembly plant, arguing that it is central to the work, and stands for post-Fordist late capitalism. Similar, it shows at how socio-economic inequalities of the border are encoded, and critiques the structural inequities of the border economy. In creating a virtual board game that acts as a refracted mirror of the sociocultural space of the US-Mexico border, we retrace the steps of the Surrealists and the Situationists .
