obj003,AMBOS Project,http://www.ambosproject.com/7,,"AMBOS Project started as a month long activation at the San Ysidro border crossing in Tijuana, but has evolved its focus to record and paint a picture of what life looks like along the length of the US/Mexico border for those who are unfamiliar with the realities that take place there. Through the different phases of the project, AMBOS has fostered a greater sense of interconnectedness in the border regions it has visited. AMBOS as a project has become multi-faceted. It is part documentation of the border, part collaboration with artists, part community activism, part exploration of identities influenced by the liminal zone of the borderlands. By connecting with local artists, activists, and makers in the border region, AMBOS is working to capture an accurate representation of the sister cities and communities on both sides. In making community-based art, AMBOS also functions as an emotional thermometer to gauge the health of policy and transnational relationships in each community. AMBOS seeks to generate healthier cross-border relationships between communities and governmental bodies by raising awareness of issues and opinion in the border region and amplifying them to an international audience. Through these efforts, AMBOS recontextualizes and calls attention to the importance and lack of accessibility at US borders. Using craft and art as a vehicle for community self-care, this project is aimed at humanizing the act of border crossing.

It ia a game to be played individually, like solitaire, in order to allow people who are not gaming devotees to partake of the game with ease. Players have the option to enter the game in English or Spanish and choose from among four player personae. The language and personae chosen determine the particular perspective on life experiences in the border region that each player have so that the more conversant one is in various idioms of the border, the more one can know about all the angles of the game and the more one has access to ""insider"" information on both sides of the border. The paths of each player allude to actual experiences that are typical of real life regular border crossers, from elderly Americans who go to Tijuana to buy cheaper prescription drugs medicine, to Mexican day laborers who make their way on foot along Route 5 each day and peddle their skills and trades in San Diego's suburbs. The game represents the US-Mexico border as material locality, and as representative of particular (corporate) practices. It focuses on the maquiladora or assembly plant, arguing that it is central to the work, and stands for post-Fordist late capitalism. Similar, it shows at how socio-economic inequalities of the border are encoded, and critiques the structural inequities of the border economy.

In the sixteenth century, early colonial pictographic maps drawn by indigenous artists reflect the growth of Spanish colonial administration. These maps show how indigenous elites adapted pre-Hispanic visual traditions to Europeanized forms of documentation to record their histories and defend claims to land and power. In the eighteenth century, new maps of Mexicos principal cities serve as both representations and instruments of the viceregal governments efforts to re-order and regulate Mexican social life and public spaces. In the nineteenth century, maps are central to the military struggle for independence and the defense of contested national borders.","The University of Texas at Austin, LLILAS/Benson Latin American Collections, Jullianne Gilland",,,,,active,071,united_item,united,img/derivatives/simple/obj072/thumbnail.jpg,img/derivatives/simple/obj072/full.jpg

As an additional resource to make the mural accessible to the public and educators, it has created a digital mural free to use and download.  The inclusion of QR codes has allowed audiences the opportunity to not only listen and watch the narratives but to also take agency in sharing the stories, facilitating their participation in creating consciousness of immigrant life in the U.S. and life after deportation.

American slaveholders began migrating to the Mexican province of Texas in the 1820s, where they established a society like those developing at the same time in Mississippi and Alabama. Tensions quickly rose between these Anglo settlers and the government of Mexico, which repeatedly attempted to outlaw slavery in Texas. Settlers in the region eventually rebelled from Mexico in 1836 and established the Republic of Texas. From 1836 to 1845, slaveholders from the American South poured into this new nation between the borders of the United States and Mexico. Centered on a database of slave and slaveholder populations in Texas during the Republic era (1837-45), the Texas Slavery Project offers a window into the role slavery played in the development of Texas in the years before the region became part of the United States. Dynamic interactive maps show the changing flows of enslaved and slaveholder populations in Texas over time. The population database search engine allows users to discover the growth of slave and slaveholder populations in the region.

Its data is particularly valuable in allowing researchers to learn more about the mobility patterns of the nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes of Texas, and how these patterns changed over time. It will also give us a more complete picture of the wide-ranging nature of inter-ethnic conflict in Texas.","Dr. Sam Haynes, Brandon Blakeslee, Charles Grand, Barbara Moore, Elias Perez, University of Texas at Arlington Libraries, Harini Akkanapragada, Ben Huseman, Andrew Leverenz, Candy McCormic, Krystal Schenk, Chirag Shah, Ali Behseresht, Ramona Holmes, Lynn F.

Their inter-disciplinary projects address issues of citizenship, migration, informal economies, and popular cultural, while arguing for understanding the border not as a bifurcating line, but as a region that expands and contracts with the movement of people and objects. They currently work between Tijuana, MX, San Diego, CA, Santa Ana, CA and Los Angeles, CA.","Misael Diaz, Amy Sanchez",cognate.collective@gmail.com,https://www.facebook.com/cognate.collective/,,,active,027,united_item,united,img/derivatives/simple/obj028/thumbnail.jpg,img/derivatives/simple/obj028/full.jpg
