Borders in North America have changed and transformed over the course of centuries, from indigenous boundaries to the militarized Mexican-United States border that currently exists today. The [“Mexico-United States exhibit”](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/projects/) of [*United Fronteras*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/) is an excellent example of a collaborative driven digital humanities project, featuring over 100 web resources from both countries which engage the changing border in different and exciting ways. 

The exhibit highlights projects relating to history, literature, art, migration and more.  Whereas some projects are more academic in focus, others encourage wide audiences who want to learn more about the border. For example, digital repositories are featured that hold archival sources of both sides of the border located at national institutions, such as: the Library of Congress, [*Mexican Revolution and the United States*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj076/); Newberry Library Digital Collection, [*The Everett D. Graff Collection of Western Americana*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj103/); Coahuila Gobierno del Estado, [*Coahuila Enciclopedia Digital*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj027/); or at the [Hemeroteca Nacional Digital de México](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj056/).

As a historian of twentieth century transnational U.S.-Mexican history, I am looking forward to engaging with this exhibit as a place to encounter more sources of information. Although I was aware of some sites, I did not knew about the large majority of resources featured on the exhibit. For instance, newspapers are part of my main area of research, and the exhibit of *United Fronteras* features digital collections/projects that hold/identify this kind of primary sources. Among them are: [*California  Digital Newspapers Collection*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/search/), [*Borderlands Archives Cartography*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj016/), [*Historic Mexican and Mexican American Press*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj058/), or [Hemeroteca Joaquín Meade](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj057/), among others.  

Digital collections, in particular, are more vital now than ever, increasing accessibility to sources previously difficult to access because of travel or monetary means.  I am also excited to utilize this exhibit as a teaching tool. It is a great starting point for students to learn about a plethora of subjects, whether they be about immigration, such as [*Rural Immigration Network / Red Rural de Inmigración*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj098/) or the inactive project of [*The Immigration Project*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj104/), indigenous lands, like the [*Southern Colorado Borderlands*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj099/) or [*Pee Posh Migration*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj088/), or genealogies, such as [*Mexican Genealogy*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj075/) or [*The Doña Ana Sphere*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj037/). These resources themselves open the door to students to cultivate an interest in the Mexican-United States border and work around borders, which matters more now than ever.

In an age of increasing nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric pushing for the hardening of borders, it is our duty as scholars to demonstrate the contested nature of boundaries more than ever, as it is stated in [*United Fronteras*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/about/), and through registers such as the "Mexico-United States exhibit", that does just that.
