Latina/os have joined communities, filled jobs in various sectors, and made local economies 
flourish throughout the United States. To study this, the fields of borderlands and Latina/o
studies have responded with promising geographical growth. Scholars from both fields are
teaching budding students not only in such cities as San Diego, Tucson, El Paso, and Miami but
also in the towns and cities of states like Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa. Groundbreaking books
and articles of Latina/os and their community building in Arkansas, Mississippi, the Dakotas,
and other locales are in print. Perhaps more importantly, more books and articles are in
development. Such work is decentering the traditional sense of place within borderlands and
Latina/o studies, pushing both fields deeper into the nation’s interior.1 This process has led to a
richer understanding of Latina/os, the United States, and their various borderlands.

*United Fronteras* in its [first phase, Mexico-United States borderlands](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/), features two digital projects that are at the foreground of furthering our
understanding of borderlands and Latina/os: [*Southern Colorado Borderlands*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj099/) and [*Rural
Immigration Network (RIN)*](https://unitedfronteras.github.io/ufexhibition_mexusa/united/obj098/). *Southern Colorado Borderlands* reminds us that the U.S.-Mexico
Border was not always set at the Rio Grande. Before 1848 it was hundreds of miles north along
the Arkansas River that originates in Colorado. Along the Rocky Mountains-Great Plains
borderlands of Southern Colorado, Indigenous people, ethnic Mexicans, Anglo Americans,
Europeans, empires, and nations have met. Part of an exhibit at [El Pueblo History Museum](https://www.historycolorado.org/el-pueblo-history-museum),
*Southern Colorado Borderlands* illuminates the continuous regional and ethnic-cultural borders
present in Colorado via historic images, maps, and other research materials. Notably, Southern
Colorado Borderlands reminds us that Latina/os, especially those of Mexican origin, have a deep
history in what is now the United States that predates the American Revolution.

*Rural Immigration Network* focuses upon mostly recently formed Latina/o communities.
However, much as *Southern Colorado Borderlands*, *Rural Immigration Network* serves the
broad public. Using community-based research practices, Katherine Tegtmeyer Pak [(St Olaf
College)](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) worked alongside students and other professors to create the project in 2014, and it
continues to grow. *Rural Immigration Network* is geared towards advocates, teachers, health care
providers, community planners, volunteers, public officials, as well as other groups and
individuals seeking to make rural locations better places to live. It does so through an interactive
map that exhibits various community organizations across the nation, especially in the rural
Midwest. Via this tool, visitors to the digital project can find healthcare, educational, and other
community-service organizations near them. In addition, the project shares helpful social science
research through clearly written essays, which link to more in-depth sources. Overall, *Rural
Immigration Network*, “allows community builders to learn from others like themselves, creating
an online network that stretches across geographic distances and highlights efforts to empower
and support immigrant newcomers in rural areas.” 2

*Rural Immigration Network* focuses on connecting people to better individual and community
life in a myriad of ways. *Southern Colorado Borderlands* centers on historical education for the
public. Together, *Southern Colorado Borderlands* and *Rural Immigration Network* reveal the
broad geographies and time spans borderlands and Latina/o scholars must consider. Ultimately,
by interconnect scholarship and digital tools, these projects demonstrate the academic, social,
and cultural potential of digital humanities.
