**Phase one (Mexico-United States Borderland)**

The creation of this exhibition met the following steps:


●	We identified projects that a) talked about the border and b) had at least one digital or technological component.


●	The metadata of the projects was created, based on the information provided in the project’s site. Then the authors were contacted to inform them about this initiative and to request permission to publish and incorporate their projects in this exhibit.


●	The collaborators were divided into a content team (in charge of debugging the data), a design team (responsible for the image of the page) and a technical team (in charge of minimal computing and programming).
