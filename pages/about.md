This exhibition is a window to United Fronteras, a digital directory of projects documenting contacts and divergences in the Mexico and the United States border region from pre-colonial times to the 21st century. This digital cultural record shows this area from different perspectives, which include literature, archives, art, oral histories, music, etc., and compiles active, inactive, and in development platforms that make use of digital and/or technological components.

The intent is to bring together past, current, and ongoing works to initiate a dialogue about the United States-Mexico border. This sample contains initiatives that have been created in recent years and which represent relevant discourses of resistance and activism, as well as previously projects founded that highlight the local, regional and/or national cultural heritage of the area. In addition to temporary initiatives that were exhibited in public spaces or in local museums.

It is a digital cultural record that takes advantage of the principles of minimal computing to contribute to the democratization of knowledge, understanding that “the digital cultural record is constructed and disseminated publicly, online, in a digital milieu beset with its own politics of identity” (Risam 6).

The goal is to investigate the critical work carried out in this complex region and create alternative spaces that provide resources and information about this area. In addition, it seeks to redraw the border by opposing negative representations of its territories, communities and cultures.
