The projects in this exhibition form a digital directory that includes different disciplines and focuses on the border between Mexico and the United States. By clicking on any of the images displayed below, you will find a brief description of the project and the links to access it.

The categories were narrowed to active, inactive and in development projects because the initiative of United Fronteras is, precisely, to unite the region and eliminate the labels that point to border communities, its history, their cultures and their interactions. In the near future it is intended to include the category of the type of digital component or technology that the project incorporates such as the use of digital mapping, video games, virtual reality, digital archives, oral histories, blogs, amongst many others.

The curatorship of this exhibition is the result of the collaborative work of academics from different universities in Mexico and the United States. Each project included in this index has the approval of its creators or the data collected is based on information provided directly from the projects’ sites. It should be noted that there were projects that were not included since their authors/institution did not approve their incorporation, however, this does not mean that United Fronteras excludes them or is not aware of this material/topics as part of the Mexico-United States borderlands’ digital cultural record. Likewise, United Fronteras is constantly identifying and open for the incorporation of projects that comply with the established protocols.
